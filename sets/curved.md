## Tudor

We've been unable to find examples of curved walls in a Tudor style, so we've never implemented sets for this. If you are interested in these happening, [Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/masterworktools) can [vote](http://openforge.masterwork-tools.com/) on new tiles.

## Rough Stone

Rough stone is a varation of ruined stone, where the pieces are complete.  If you print rough stone, we suggest also printing the full range of ruined variations, as the two work really well together to make partially intact buildings or rooms.

## Ruined Stone
