# OpenForge Sets
## Introduction
We think in general it's a good idea to have one set that you have a ton of tiles for, with lots of flexibility, and then a bunch of smaller sets where you can build a few rooms with some differing flair. It seems counterintuitive, but cut-stone is designed to actually be a little boring, which makes it a perfect set for the large set. It's easy to add flair to the dungeon with a few interesting tiles, or scatter terrain, but your basic set will serve you better if it is more of a plain pallet you can use to build a bunch of different things. The more distinctive it is, the harder it is to use for different game situations.  Once you have selected the base set you intend to use, then you can extend it with various tiles, and other, smaller sets to add visual interest, or to make particular areas of your map vary for game reasons.

There is no need to stick to OpenForge for all your tiles.  The bases we produce can work with basically any other project's tiles. You just need to cut off 6mm from the base of any other  tile system, something that most slicers can do, but can also easily be done in blender with a cube and a boolean difference.  Select a connection system, and go with that universally. We love doing openlock + magnetic. Magnets make life way easier when you are quickly building a map at the table. Openlock makes it much easier to build rooms ahead of time that you don't have to worry about getting knocked apart. The combination is great. You'll also want to choose a square size, which is a bit more complicated. OpenForge internal tiles and dwarven forge are based on 25mm squares. Printable Scenery, Dragonlock  and Hirstarts are based on 1" squares. To make the 25mm tiles the 1" scale, scale them up to 101.6%. To do the reverse, scale 1" tiles down to 98.4%. however, the OpenForge bases are already the right size. DO NOT SCALE THEM, as it will break the openlock connectors.  We have not started altering the file names, but in the future, the file names will contain the square basis so that it's super easy from the outset to understand what scale things are in.

All of our set suggestions below are based on the preference for Magnets + OpenLOCK.  You can always swap in what base you prefer. Some people prefer to use our plain bases that have no texture on them so that all the tiles line up perfectly.  Some people prefer the bases to carry the texture of the tile all the way through.  The bases have a broad variety including magnet, openlock, magnetic + openlock, openlock triplex, plain, and any other base you want to imagine.

## Basic Set

To create a basic set, you will want a selection that lets you build a few small rooms, or a larger, more complex room. To that end, we suggest you start off with the following:

376 Magnets

* 14 2x2 walls
* 8 2x2 corners
* 12 2x2 floors
* 2 4x4 floors
* 4 2x2 doors
* 2 4x2 wide doors
* 2 2x2 windows

### Cut-Stone

376 Magnets

* [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1419276), [Wall Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1640988), [Wall Backs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1641002)
* [Corners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1434550), [Corner Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1727359), [Corner Backs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1727402)
* [Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1422779)
* [Arched Doors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1440089) or [Wood Frame Doors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1722459) (consider doing a full set of both)
* [Arched Windows](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1541301) or [Square Windows](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1674376) (consider doing a full set of both)

### Cut-Stone Half-Height

Windows and Doors don't make much sense at half-height.  If your goal is to create a set that lets you easily see the miniatures, we suggest printing the half-height set and then printing full height doors and windows above.

* [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1591395)
* [Corners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1598304)
* [Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1422779) (Same as Cut-Stone floors above)

### Tudor

376 Magnets

* [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1598377), [Wall Variations Set 1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1598386), [Wall Variations Set 2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1618353), [Wall Construction Kit Parts](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1641003), [Wall Construction Kit Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1640999)

### Rough Stone
Rough stone is a varation of ruined stone, where the pieces are complete.  If you print rough stone, we suggest also printing the full range of ruined variations, as the two work really well together to make partially intact buildings or rooms.

### Ruined Stone
Ruined stone is a varation of rough stone, where the pieces are not entirely complete.  If you print rough stone, we suggest also printing the full range of ruined variations, as the two work really well together to make partially intact buildings or rooms.

### Tudor

We've been unable to find examples of curved walls in a Tudor style, so we've never implemented sets for this. If you are interested in these happening, [Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/masterworktools) can [vote](http://openforge.masterwork-tools.com/) on new tiles.
