# OpenForge Sets
## Introduction

## Basic Set

To create a basic set, you will want a selection that lets you build a few small rooms, or a larger, more complex room. To that end, we suggest you start off with the following:

* 14 walls
* 8 corners
* 12 2x2 floors
* 2 4x4 floors
* 4 doors
* 2 wide doors
* 2 windows

### Cut-Stone

* [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1419276)
* [Corners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1434550)
* [Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1422779) Contains both 2x2 & 4x4
* [Arched Doors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1440089) or [Wood Frame Doors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1722459) (consider doing a full set of both)
* [Arched Windows](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1541301) or [Square Windows](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1674376) (consider doing a full set of both)

### Cut-Stone Half-Height

* [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1591395)
* [Corners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1598304)
* [Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1422779) (Same as Cut-Stone floors above)

Windows and Doors don't make much sense at half-height.  If your goal is to create a set that lets you easily see the miniatures, we suggest printing the half-height set and then printing full height doors and windows above.

### Tudor

We've been unable to find examples of curved walls in a Tudor style, so we've never implemented sets for this. If you are interested in these happening, [Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/masterworktools) can [vote](http://openforge.masterwork-tools.com/) on new tiles.
