# OpenForge Sets
## Introduction

## Basic Set

To create a basic set, you will want a selection that lets you build a few small rooms, or a larger, more complex room. To that end, we suggest you start off with the following:

376 Magnets

* 14 2x2 walls
* 8 2x2 corners
* 12 2x2 floors
* 2 4x4 floors
* 4 2x2 doors
* 2 4x2 wide doors
* 2 2x2 windows

### Cut-Stone

376 Magnets

* [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1419276), [Wall Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1640988), [Wall Backs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1641002)
* [Corners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1434550), [Corner Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1727359), [Corner Backs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1727402)
* [Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1422779)
* [Arched Doors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1440089) or [Wood Frame Doors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1722459) (consider doing a full set of both)
* [Arched Windows](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1541301) or [Square Windows](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1674376) (consider doing a full set of both)

### Cut-Stone Half-Height

* [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1591395)
* [Corners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1598304)
* [Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1422779) (Same as Cut-Stone floors above)

Windows and Doors don't make much sense at half-height.  If your goal is to create a set that lets you easily see the miniatures, we suggest printing the half-height set and then printing full height doors and windows above.

### Tudor

376 Magnets

* [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1598377), [Wall Variations Set 1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1598386), [Wall Variations Set 2](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1618353), [Wall Construction Kit Parts](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1641003), [Wall Construction Kit Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1640999)
* [Corners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1635716), [Corner Variations Set 1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1635721) [Corner Construction Kit Parts](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1727412), [Corner Construction Kit Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1727367)
* [Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1585586)
* [Wood Frame Doors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1649422), [Wood Frame Door Variations Set 1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1649437)
* [Square Windows](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1659308)

### Rough Stone
Rough stone is a varation of ruined stone, where the pieces are complete.  If you print rough stone, we suggest also printing the full range of ruined variations, as the two work really well together to make partially intact buildings or rooms.

400 Magnets

* [Walls](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2275577)
  * 14 of ruined_wall.wall.ckit.2x.full.stl
  * If you want half-height, instead ruined_wall.wall.ckit.2x.half.stl
  * 2 each of broken_stone_floor.wall.ckit.2x2.a - broken_stone_floor.wall.ckit.2x2.i
* [Corners](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2328221)
  * 8	ruined_wall.corner.ckit.2x.full.stl or 8 of ruined_wall.corner.ckit.2x.half.stl if you want half height
  * 8 of broken_stone_floor.corner.ckit.2x2.a - broken_stone_floor.corner.ckit.2x2.i
* [Floors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2244962)
  * 2x each of 2x2.a - 2x2.i (18 total, but gives a lot of variation)
  * 2x of 4x4
* [Wood Framed Doors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2423018)
  * 4x of ruined_door_square.ckit.2x.full-full
  * 4x of ruined_floor.door.ckit.2x2.stl
  * 4x of door_lintel_1, 2 or 3
  * 4x of tudor_square_door

* [Square Windows](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2503963)
  * 2x ruined_wall.window.ckit.2x.full
  * Use 2 of the floors printed for the walls that were left over

### Ruined Stone
Ruined stone is a varation of rough stone, where the pieces are not entirely complete.  If you print rough stone, we suggest also printing the full range of ruined variations, as the two work really well together to make partially intact buildings or rooms.

If you are interested in the missing tiles happening, [Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/masterworktools) can [vote](http://openforge.masterwork-tools.com/) on new tiles.

### Tudor

We've been unable to find examples of curved walls in a Tudor style, so we've never implemented sets for this. If you are interested in these happening, [Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/masterworktools) can [vote](http://openforge.masterwork-tools.com/) on new tiles.
