# Basic Set

Some GMs may not want the complexity of walls.  For this set, the assumption is that what you want is to have floors only, with walls only used for special things like doors and windows.  This set, like the other basic set gives you a selection that lets you build a few small rooms, or a larger, more complex room. To that end, we suggest you start off with the following:

Requires 1-2 1 kg rolls of filament and 376 Magnets.  You will also need some cyanoacrylate glue (superglue).

* 20 2x2 floors
* 4 2x4 floors
* 6 4x4 floors
* 4 2x2 doors
* 2 4x2 wide doors
* 2 2x2 windows

For flexibility, and to maximize the chances of producing usable parts we suggest using construction kit versions of tiles wherever possible.
