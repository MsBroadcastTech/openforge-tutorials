## Painting

![Prime Tile](2019-11-30_12.25.13.jpg)
* Prime the tile in black primer. I love the Krylon Fusion paints, they are super flat and bind to plastic really well.  This also shows the colors to be used for the stone.

![Prime Doors](2019-11-30_12.38.22.jpg)
* Prime the doors in dark brown primer. This also shows the paints to be used for the doors.

![Soft Black](2019-11-30_12.27.53.jpg)
First paint the stone soft black

![Burnt Sienna](2019-11-30_12.36.15.jpg)
Then two coats of burn sienna, but make it like a very heavy drybrush. you want some of the soft black coming through in the crevices.

![Spanish Tile](2019-11-30_12.37.54.jpg)
Finally, drybrush on the spanish tile

![Raw Umber](2019-11-30_12.51.16.jpg)
The doors were primed in a dark brown, so they don't need the first layer. Here we are putting on raw umber on the wood.  If you primed the doors in black, hit them with raw umber as well.

![Milk Chocolate](2019-11-30_13.06.29.jpg)
Heavy drybrush of milk chocolate, 2 layers.  You basically want this color everywhere except the deep crevices.

![Honey Brown](2019-11-30_13.12.48.jpg)
Light drybrush of Honey Brown.

![Gun Metal](2019-11-30_13.26.32.jpg)
Then the metal in gunmetal

![Hinge](2019-11-30_13.27.38.jpg)
Straighten and clip some paperclips for hinges.
