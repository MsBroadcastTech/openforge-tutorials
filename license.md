How Do OpenForge Licenses Work
==============================

Free to use and sell
--------------------
We very consiously choose the licenses on the files we release.  OpenForge licenses, and exceptions to them for patrons apply to any thingiverse entries under [devonjones](https://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones/designs) with "OpenForge" or "OpenLOCK" in the title, and any Thingiverse entries under [ecaroth](https://www.thingiverse.com/ecaroth/designs) with "OpenForge" in the title.  We mark what can and can't be sold by the licence on Thingiverse. There are currently two groupings of files.

All of [Cut-Stone](https://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones/collections/openforge-2-cut-stone-series), [Dungeon Stone](https://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones/collections/openforge-2-dungeon-stone-series), [Rough/Ruined Stone](https://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones/collections/openforge-2-rough-and-ruined-stone-series) and [Tudor](https://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones/collections/openforge-2-tudor-series) are under the CC-BY-SA, which only means that you need to attribute us, and if you modify the designs you would need to release them under the CC-BY-SA. All future releases for these sets will also be under the CC-BY-SA.  Some of our scatter is also under the CC-BY-SA.

Second, we have some newer sets - [Dwarven Halls](https://www.thingiverse.com/devonjones/collections/openforge-2-dwarven-halls), the forthcoming cavern set, and newer scatter that are under the CC-BY-SA-NC. Those you cannot sell unless you sign up on patreon as a Merchanit Tier ($10/month) supporter. Then you will gain the right to ignore the NC and SA parts of the license.

From the merchant tier:

Merchants are a special tier. Many of our models are available under the CC-BY-SA, Newer premium designs are under the CC-BY-SA-NC.  At the merchant tier, you can ignore the Share Alike and Non Commercial clauses of the license, meaning that you can sell prints from NC licensed models, and you can incorporate any design into your own that you can cover with any license you want so long as you still attribute the project.

DungeonSticks
-------------

DungeonSticks are cross licensed.  Merchants can still print and sell these pieces, but to get the license to do dungeon sticks, we also agreed to allow the merchant tier of EC3D to sell the same pieces.  OpenForge Merchant tier patrons can print and sell files from any thingiverse entry with "DungeonStick" in the name under devonjones, but only EC3D Merchants can do the same for thingiverse entries with "DungeonStick" in the name under ecaroth.
