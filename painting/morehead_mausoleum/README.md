## Painting

[Prime](2017-04-12_08.18.17.jpg)
* Prime the pieces with dark brown primer. I love the Krylon Fusion paints, they are super flat and bind to plastic really well.

[Burnt Sienna](2017-04-12_08.44.28.jpg)
* Hit the stone areas with medium coverage of Burnt Sienna. You want to make sure the deep areas still show through with the dark brown.

[Raw Sienna](2017-04-12_09.04.49.jpg)
* Now do a lighter coverage of Raw Sienna. Not quite a drybrush, but make sure the paintbrush is not particularly full of paint.

[Honey Brown](2017-04-12_09.23.03.jpg)
* Now drybrush with Honey brown. This is intended to be a highlight, so you want to focus on it ending up on the upturned edges of the piece. I do this by only moving the brush down against the part.

[Fawn](2017-04-12_09.30.36.jpg)
* (Optional) Now use fawn to pick out about 5 blocks per piece. Drybrush the fawn on and onto the same brick on the reverse side. Pick different bricks for each of the 4 parts.

[Sepia Wash](2017-04-12_09.42.23.jpg)
* (Optional) Now use a sepia wash and pick out 5 more bricks. Cover the whole brick with the wash on front and back. This is called glazing. We are using the wash to tint the entire brick.

[Brown Wash](2017-04-12_09.48.39.jpg)
* (Optional) Finally glaze 5 more random bricks with a brown wash. Brown and sepia are similar, but the hue is still different, and the bricks will give some variation.

[Highlight](2017-04-12_09.59.49.jpg)
* (Optional) Highlight the stone embelishments (the arches, pillars and base of the niche) with a mix of Desert Sand and Honey Brown

[Grate: Black Wash](2017-04-12_09.50.17.jpg)
* Use a black wash inside the grate at the bottom

[Grate: Dark Metallic](2017-04-12_09.52.44.jpg)
* Use a very dark metallic on the grate itself. I used Adamantium Black.

[Grate: Dark Metallic](2017-04-12_09.54.31.jpg)
* Highlight the grate with a lighter metallic. I chose to also go for a more dull color in Aged Pewter to show the age.

[Embellishments: Bronze](2017-04-12_10.14.13.jpg)
* Paint the tracery on the top, the rods and the small symbol above the niche with a bronze paint. Here I use Old Bronze.

[Embellishments: Verdigris](2017-04-12_10.21.58.jpg)
* Mix a green and a blue to create a turquoise. Then add a wash medium and some water. I use equal parts Liquitex Matte Medium and water to make the wash. If you don't have that, you can use water and a little rubbing alcohol to make the wash. The alcohol will make it so the wash also sticks to surfaces instead of just going for the crevices.

[Embellishments: Verdigris Highlights](2017-04-12_10.26.54.jpg)
* I took my green which was already close to a turquoise and dry brushed the raised surfaces to get more verdegris on the metal.

[Door: Prime](2017-04-12_16.57.17.jpg)
* Paint the door and door arch (glue 2 back to back) with the krylon flat dark brown

[Door: Burnt Umber](2017-04-12_17.00.32.jpg)
* Hit the wood on the door with Burnt Umber

[Door: Milk Chocolate](2017-04-12_17.02.14.jpg)
* Do a lighter layer with Milk Chocolate. I'm keeping the browns a different hue from the stone to make it clear that this is wood.

[Door: Dry Brush](2017-04-12_17.04.24.jpg)
* Dry brush with Honey Brown

[Door: Metal](2017-04-12_17.08.08.jpg)
* I used the Aged Pewter on all the metal parts and on the two sides.

[Door: Black Lining](2017-04-12_17.10.20.jpg)
* Then lined around the metal parts with a black wash.

[Door Arch](2017-04-12_17.14.04.jpg)
* Paint the arch and the top of the door like the rest of the stonework.

## Construction

[Construction: Walls](2017-04-12_10.29.49.jpg)
* Glue some short lengths of filament into two of the walls. A pin vice can be useful in this step if the holes are not well cleared.

[Construction: Walls](2017-04-12_10.32.14.jpg)
* Glue two sides together, making sure that the filament sides are oriented so you can glue the two halves together. The filament acts as a strengthener to keep the bond between sides strong.

[Construction: Walls](2017-04-12_10.33.55.jpg)
* Glue the two halves together and clamp.

[Construction: Floors](2017-04-12_10.48.43.jpg)
* If using the floors, glue them into two halves and wait to dry.

[Construction: Floors](2017-04-12_10.50.51.jpg)
* Then glue the two sides together.

[Construction: Pillars](2017-04-12_15.43.35.jpg)
* Flip over and glue the pillars in the corners. The pillars are painted the same way as the rest.

[Construction: Awning](2017-04-12_15.48.59.jpg)
* Glue the painted roof and arches to the building, but *not* the pillars. There's an outline on the building of where these two pieces should be glued. I found it works out better if you glue the arches first and then the roof.

[Construction: Door Assembly](2017-04-12_17.15.35.jpg)
* Slide the decorative arch in, then the door. Don't glue, this is made to be able to hold windows (like 3 sides of the real mausoleum) or a wall. Both of which I plan on releasing later.
